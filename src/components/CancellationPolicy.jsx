              <span>"Sundays Forever"</span> has crafted two types of
              cancellation policies - Flexible and Strict - to protect the
              interests of both guests and hosts alike. Guests are requested to
              read and understand the Cancellation, Refund, Reschedule, and
              other Policies applicable before making a booking.
            </p>
            <h5>Flexible Cancellation Policy </h5>
            <p>
              Guests are entitled to a 12-hour free cancellation policy from the
              time of booking, provided they have booked online without the
              assistance of the call center. Refunds will usually take 5-7
              working days to be processed into their bank accounts. This policy
              does not apply to bookings where the check-in date is 7 days or
              less from the date of confirmation of the booking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Guests are entitled to a 75% refund if they cancel their confirmed
              booking up to 15 days before the check-in date (before 1 PM). They
              are entitled to a 50% refund if they cancel up to 7 days before
              the check-in date (before 1 PM). If they cancel within 7 days of
              the check-in date, they are not entitled to a refund.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the guest has made a partial payment, they are not entitled to
              a refund. If a guest uses the "NOCANCEL" coupon while booking, all
              cancellation policies are overridden, and the guest is not
              entitled to any refund and will have to pay a 100% reschedule fee
              in the event of rescheduling.
            </p>
            <h5>Strict Cancellation Policy </h5>
            <p>
              Guests are entitled to a 12-hour free cancellation policy from the
              time of booking, provided they have booked online without the
              assistance of the call center. Refunds will usually take 5-7
              working days to be processed into their bank accounts. This policy
              does not apply to bookings where the check-in date is 7 days or
              less from the date of confirmation of the booking.
            </p>
            <p>
              After this 12-hour window has passed, bookings for homes that have
              the strict cancellation policy cannot be cancelled, rescheduled,
              or refunded. If the guest has made a partial payment, they are not
              entitled to a refund. If a guest uses the "NOCANCEL" coupon while
              booking, all cancellation policies are overridden, and the guest
              is not entitled to any refund and will have to pay a 100%
              reschedule fee in the event of rescheduling.
            </p>
            <h5>Terms & Conditions</h5>
            <p>
               In case of any refunds owed to guests, "Sundays Forever" will
              process the refund within 5-7 working days. A nominal cancellation
              fee of 5% will be levied for refunds processed by "Sundays
              Forever." This fee is primarily levied to cover payment gateway
              charges and minimal processing charges, and GST at the applicable
              rate will be charged on this cancellation fee.
            </p>
            <p>
              A reservation is considered officially cancelled when the guest
              clicks the cancellation button on the cancellation confirmation
              page or calls the reservations agent and confirms the
              cancellation. If the guest checks in and decides to leave early,
              any refund of the accommodation fee and cleaning fee will be
              decided and settled as deemed appropriate by "Sundays Forever."
            </p>
            <h5>Reschedule Policy </h5>
            <p>
              Bookings can be rescheduled only at the same home. If the tariff
              of the new dates is higher than the original booking, the
              difference must be paid to "Sundays Forever" to confirm the new
              dates. "Sundays Forever" allows rescheduling only up to 2 days
              before the check-in date. If the booking is rescheduled within 12
              hours of payment (not valid on stays where check-in is within 7
              days of booking), there is no reschedule fee. If the booking is
              rescheduled up to 7 days before the check-in date (before 1 pm)
            </p>
            <h5>Early Check-in and Late Check-out Policy </h5>
            <p>
              However, we are happy to offer a complimentary early check-in by
              12 noon, provided the villa is not booked for the previous night.
              If you would like to check-in earlier (as early as 9:00 am), there
              will be a charge of 20% of the tariff for that night.
            </p>
            <p>
              For late check-out, we can offer a complimentary check-out by
              11:00 am if the villa is not booked for that day. We will let you
              know by 8 am on the checkout date, as we do accept instant online
              and last-minute bookings. If you need a further extended checkout,
              there will be a charge of 20% of the tariff for that night for a
              checkout up to 3 pm and 40% for a checkout up to 6 pm. Full night
              charges apply after that.
            </p>

            <p>
              Please note that early check-in and late check-out are subject to
              availability and at the discretion of Sundays Forever.
            </p>
            <h5>Refund</h5>
            <p>
              Sundays Forever will process any owed refunds within 5-7 working
              days. There will be a nominal cancellation fee of 5% to cover
              payment gateway charges and minimal processing fees.
